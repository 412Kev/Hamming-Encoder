# Hamming-Encoder

This project was for Operating Systems class in spring 2017
-The way this project works is you enter a message in  datafile.txt.
-Next you run the java program Hamming.java
-Then the program will encode the message and write it to encoded.txt
-Finally it will decode the message and write it to decoded.txt
